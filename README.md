# Logic.AI
<h2>Purpose</h2> Currently, there are many all-in-one AI tools available on the market that allow users to train an AI model without writing code. However, there are few applications that take the trained models and use them for processing. Therefore, we have developed a NO CODE tool that allows users to easily apply logical reasoning to identify patterns in data.
